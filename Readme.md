### Why You Are a Good Fit for This Role
I am an excellent fit for the R&D Engineer role at Synopsys because I have a deep-seated passion for solving complex computational problems and a proven foundation in algorithms and data structures. My project work, while centered on web technologies, demonstrates my ability to architect robust, performance-oriented systems from scratch. For example, in my ride-booking project, I focused on optimizing backend logic to reduce booking latency by 60%. In another project, I engineered a real-time collaborative editor, tackling challenges like seamless conflict resolution between multiple users.

My core interest lies not just in building applications, but in the underlying algorithms that make them efficient and powerful. Implementing the Dancing Links algorithm for my Sudoku solver and advancing to Level 2 in the competitive Flipkart Grid 6.0 challenge are testaments to my dedication to algorithmic excellence. This drive to innovate and optimize is precisely what attracts me to Synopsys's pioneering work in the EDA industry.
